# Your Project's Name 
Band website 

This project is to create a website for a fictional band known as the strawhats with the characters taken from the anime one piece. This website serves as a way for fans to find out more about their favourite band and for oganisations to book them for events.
 
## Design Process

Since this website is for both fans and organisers, i have decided to include an about page, photos and music page so that fans can find out more about the band. I have decided later on to add a socials on the contact us page so that fans can also find the band on social media platforms to see more content from the band. As for organisers, they would be able to see the newest music video of the band on the music page and decide if they want to contact the band to book them for gigs/shows. The contact us page allows them to easily find the bands contact details to reach out to the band.

The top panel includes the band name on the left side and the nav bar at the right side which is common for most websites. I kept the layout of the website simple so it would be easy on the eyes and users would be able to navigate the website with ease. 
The color scheme chosen for the website is a sandy color with a darker brown to compliment the sandy color. The sandy color was chosen as it is reminiscient of the color of the strawhat the leader wears and ties in to the name of the band as well.


user stories: 
- As a fan i would want a about page so i can find out more about the band
- As an organiser i would want to have a contact section so i am able to contact the band to book them.

## Testing

While making the website, the problem i ran into the most was the alignment of the flex boxes of the the texts and photos. It took me a long time to figure out what was wrong and many trial and errors to get the flexboxes to align nicely .
